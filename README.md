Learning Objectives

Explore
Fetch species observations from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org) using an R package that wraps a function around their API.
Fetch environmental data for defining environmental relationship in the species distribution model (SDM).
Generate pseudo-absences, or background, points with which to differentiate from the species presence points in the SDM.
Extract underlying environmental data from points.
Plot term plots of each environmental predictor with the species response.

Overview
This lab dives into machine learning by predicting presence of a species of you choosing from observations and environmental data. We will largely follow guidance found at Species distribution modeling | R Spatial using slightly newer R packages and functions.
